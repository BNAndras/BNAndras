### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm AndrÃ¡s (he/him), a hobbyist coder and [Geographic Information System (GIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) analyst working in [cultural resources management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_resource_management). I'm a volunteer at [Exercism](https://exercism.org) maintaining the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), [Pyret](https://pyret.org/), and [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) language tracks and also mentoring students on several tracks, notably [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python geoprocessing tools using the [arcpy](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/main/arcgis-pro-arcpy-reference.htm) library.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Arcade](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcade/) and [Poly/ML](https://polyml.org/).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on building Exercism's language tracks.
